`weblayer`_ is a `Python`_ package for web developers who like making their own design decisions.

Built on `WebOb`_ it provides a set of components that can be used to handle requests and create a `WSGI`_ application.  It is not a framework.  In contrast, `weblayer`_ tries to prescribe as little as possible, allowing you to swap out components and work with your weapons of choice.

It's fast and fully tested.  The `source code`_ contains documentation and `examples`_.
