`weblayer`_ is a `Python`_ package, built on `WebOb`_, that provides a set of
components that can be used to handle requests within a `WSGI`_ application.

It is not a framework.  In contrast, `weblayer`_ tries to prescribe as little
as possible, allowing you to swap out components and work with your weapons 
of choice.

It's fast, tested and `documented`_.  The `source code`_ is `public domain`_.
